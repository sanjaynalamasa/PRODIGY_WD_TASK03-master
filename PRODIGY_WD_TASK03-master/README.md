# PRODIGY_WD_TASK03
I have developed a two player Tic-tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a 3rd task in web development internship. By implementing functions to handle user Web clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, you can create an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.

# JavaScript-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project consists of:
* index.html - Simple HTML page to open in a browser
* styles.css - Styling for the HTML page.
* script.js - Functionality for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## To Run
* Click on the index.html file to open it in a web browser. Play the game by clicking on the cells in the grid to add "X" or "O" symbols.
